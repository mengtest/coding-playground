        //Remember:
        //Generally, every line of code that does not start with "if" or "for" or "while"
        //must end with a semicolon ";". Not a colon ":" but a semicolon ";".

        //Every open bracket must eventually be followed by a matching closing bracket.
        //A bracket can be regular "( )" or curly "{ }".

        //The language we're using is called C#, and it's cap sensitive.
        //This means that lowercase and uppercase letters are different.

        //Exercise:
        //Delete the line "/*"
        //Delete the line "*/"
        //Fix all syntax errors.
        //Make the name of the class above "public class L2s5" exactly match the name of the file "L2S5". This include lowercase and uppercase.
